# Tic-Tac-Toe Project
This application allows for two players to play against eachother in a classic game of tic-tac-toe. This application allows the user to sign-up, sign-in, change their password and sign-out. The user is also able to look back at the history of their game stats.

This is my first time building a front end application that utilizes a backend API! :) Had some bumps along the way, but this was a great learning experience all around.

## Planning history
With this project being my first front end application, I tried to be very methodical with my approach. After building some wireframes and user stories, I focused on sorting out the user API requests, and then moved onto the game play API requests. After that it was time to start building out the logic to the game. While there are probably countless ways to achieve a functional tic-tac-toe game in JS... as Thomas Edison once said, I only needed to find one way that worked. After that I focused more on the styling of the different features.

## User Stories
- As a user I want to be able to play against someone else
- As a user I want to be able to start a new game at any time
- As a user I want to be able to make an account and sign back in
- As a user I want to be able to to track my game stat history
- As a user I want the board to be visually responsive when the game is complete
